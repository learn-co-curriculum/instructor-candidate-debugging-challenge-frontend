# JavaScript Debugging Challenge

This challenge is meant to test your ability to walk through the process of
debugging code and was originally designed for recent graduates applying to
become Software Engineering Coaches. Although the content is built for this
purpose, being able to walk through unfamiliar code, identify bugs and
communicate potential solutions is a valuable skill for any programmer.

This challenge tests your ability to debug a vanilla JavaScript
application. Types of bugs include: DOM manipulation, DOM events, typos, scoping,
user interaction.

## Student background

Imagine you are helping a student work on their portfolio project. The
student is in their second week of the program and has been exposed to:

* HTML
* CSS
* Procedural JavaScript
* DOM manipulation
* DOM events
* Promises
* XHR/fetch requests

## Deliverables

1. As a user, I can create a gravatar based on a phrase
2. As a user, I can add a comment to the gravatar
3. As a user, I can add another comment without clearing the input

## Getting Started

To start, clone down this repo and make sure JSON server is installed:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:learn-co-curriculum/instructor-candidate-debugging-challenge-frontend.git
npm i -g json-server
```

In one console, run the following commands:

```sh
cd instructor-candidate-debugging-challenge-frontend
open index.html
json-server --watch db.json
```

In the browser, generate a gravatar with the text "flatiron" first since the
database is already seeded with comments for this phrase.

All coding for this challenge will happen in the `src/index.js` file. No other
file needs to be changed, but you may be interested in what is in the other
files.

### 1. The page refreshes when I try to add a comment

#### Problem

From the imaginary student:

> I'm building an app that allows a user to type in a phrase and get a pixelated
> image generated for it. Once an image is generated, the user should be able to
> add a comment to it and the comment should render below the image. The problem
> that I'm running into is that I can't seem to submit the comment form for the
> image. The code to create the image and the code to add a comment works, but
> the comment form always refreshes the page.

Confirm the issue by going to the browser and filling out a comment for the
"flatiron" phrase. There should be seeded comments there already, and when
you try to add a new comment, the page should refresh.

Note the addition of the "?" to the end of the URL. The page is not only
refreshing, but the form is being submitted instead of being stopped by
JavaScript.

Stick to this problem first before solving others.

#### Changes

These changes can be implemented in different orders. Be sure to ask yourself
questions about what might be happening in the code. We even encourage you to talk
outloud as you work through the challenge to practice discussing your process. Try
to solve on your own before continuing

The goal is to get the form to submit without the page refreshing. One of the
first issues identified might be that the `newComment` event listener is being
added to the wrong form. Instead of attaching it to `commentForm`, it's
currently being attached to `form`:

```js
  let form = document.getElementById("identicon-form")
  form.addEventListener("submit", handleSubmit)
  let commentForm = document.getElementById("comment-form")
  commentForm.addEventListener("submit", newComment)          // updated line; form > commentForm
```

After just making this one change, the page should still refresh. In order to
prevent the page from refreshing, you will need to prevent the default form
submission; using `event.preventDefault()` does the trick in the event handler.

```js
function newComment(e) {
  e.preventDefault()                                         // added line

  // ...
}
```

#### Check

Refresh the page, put "flatiron" in the image/gravatar input box and click
"Generate". Once the image is generated, type some text into the comment input
box and click "Submit". The page should not refresh. The comment won't be
correctly added yet; that's the next step.

### 2. The comment text is not showing up in the list of comments

#### Problem

From the student:

> Now that I can get the page to stop refreshing, I want to get the text from
> the input box onto the page. Right now, it keeps saying "undefined" instead of
> the actual text that the user types in.

#### Changes

This problem can be solved in a variety of ways. Again, walk through your process
for debugging, and take note of what you're doing. Can you clearly explain what
you're doing and trying? If the solution is obvious to you, how can you convey what
the problem is in a way that makes sense? If the solution _isn't_ obvious, what is
your process for figuring it out? Try to solve before continuing.

Right now, the event target is the form instead of the input and so the value
will always be undefined.

The easiest way to solve it is to reference the other (correctly) working event
listener. You might also do other things (give the input an id, use a query
selector) to find the input and get the value from it.

```js
function newComment(e) {
  e.preventDefault()
  comment = e.target[0].value
  // comment = e.target.querySelector('input').value
  // comment = e.target.querySelector('input[type="text"]').value
  // comment = e.target.querySelector('#custom-id').value

  // ...
}
```

#### Check

Refresh the page, put "flatiron" in the image/gravatar input box and click
"Generate". Once the image is generated, type some text into the comment input
box and click "Submit". The page should not refresh. The comment text should
show up in the comments list.

### 3. Comment input box doesn't clear on submission of comment form

#### Problem

From the student:

> Okay, I've almost got everything hooked up correctly now. The only thing I
> need to finish is that the comment input box doesn't clear whenever I submit
> the form.

#### Changes

Again, a variety of ways to solve this problem. Follow the same process - how do
you figure out the problem? How do you explain what is happening in a clear way?

...

...

...

One solution is to reset the entire comment form once you don't need the comment
input value anymore. Another solution is to just reset the value of the input
itself.

```js
function newComment(e) {
  e.preventDefault()
  comment = e.target[0].value

  // ...

  e.target.reset()
  // e.target[0].value = ''
}

```

#### Check

Refresh the page, put "flatiron" in the image/gravatar input box and click
"Generate". Once the image is generated, type some text into the comment input
box and click "Submit". The page should not refresh. The comment text should
show up in the comments list. The comment input box should be empty.
